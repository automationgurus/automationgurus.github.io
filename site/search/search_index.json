Why should you read this article? What are the benefits? You don't want to browse logs though Azure DevOps web manually. You don't want to export audit logs to CSV and analyze them in Excel. You want to have all audit logs in the same place . It sounds like your regulator, doesn't it? You'll be able to search effectively across logs, using Kusto Query Language. You want to keep audit logs for more than 90 days. You'll easily bind ADO events to other events from another part of your environment. You'll Grab details about activities like permissions changes, deleted resources, branch policy changes. If you're IaC enthusiastic , then the majority of you work in ADO.
